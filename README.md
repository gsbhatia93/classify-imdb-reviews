# classify-imdb-reviews
IMDB review classification, the input reviews were first treated to unigram and bigram vectorized format. These ngram vectors of text data were then used to model Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier which then made prediction on test data. I used Python, Sklearn, Numpy and Pandas for this project.
